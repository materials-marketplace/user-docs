# Quickstart

The MarketPlace enables software vendors to register their applications onto the platform in order to make them available (i.e., executable) to users who purchased them.

This section should give them a brief overview on the resources and materials involved in the application development, registration and exploitation processes.

1. **Application creation**

   Once you have a certain piece of software or technology you want to onboard on the MarketPlace, an app must be created. This requires identifying which [capabilities](../capabilities) your application should support, and creating a web application that enables access to them.

   A good starting point is the [get started app](https://github.com/materials-marketplace/get-started-app).

1. **Application registration**

   Registering an application on the platform means telling the MarkePlace how to reach your application and the capabilities you have decided to implement.

   Check the [registration](./registration) page for a detailed description of the process. In case the application is firewall-protected, see [this](./message_broker)section.

1. **Interacting with the application**

   Apart from the swagger viewer presented in the application registration, the Marketplace also offers a Python library that can be used to communicate with registered applications.
   More information about this is available in [the SDK](../../jupyter/sdk).

1. **Tutorials and teaching**

   Support materials for users can be added to the [forum](https://forum.materials-marketplace.eu/).
   It is the perfect place for detailed descriptions, as well as potential interaction with customers.

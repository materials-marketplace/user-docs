# About applications

The MarketPlace enables software vendors to register their applications onto the platform in order to make them available (i.e., executable) to users who purchased them.

The [registration process](apps/registration.md) requires that an application declares its [capabilities](./capabilities) realised by a [REST-API that complies with the MarketPlace specifications](apps/mp-api).
In case the application is firewall-protected, an application may be registered as an [agent application](apps/register_agent) to enable secure communication with the platform.
